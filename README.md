Chatter Up

Chatter Up is a simple chat application built with Flask, jQuery and the BARD API.

The app displays a chat interface where the user can type in a question. The user's question is sent to the BARD API, which returns a response that is then displayed in the chat interface. The server response is formatted to be more readable and to remove any image references.

The chat interface also includes some features to enhance usability. When the user hits Enter in the text input field, it triggers the send function. The user's question is displayed in a green chat bubble on the left side of the screen, and the server's response is displayed in a light yellow chat bubble on the right side of the screen.
